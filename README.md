In this repo are some examples of running the MQTT Broker with and without TLS in a Linux-based OS. The MQTT Broker is the Mosquitto Broker. The examples are in two directories: `mqtt-tls` and `mqtt-no-tls`. The `mqtt-tls` directory contains the files necessary to run the MQTT Broker with TLS. The `mqtt-no-tls` directory contains the files necessary to run the MQTT Broker without TLS. This last directory is useful to run the MQTT Broker with and without authentication.

| **[/mqtt-no-tls/README.md](./mqtt-no-tls/README.md)** | File that contains the instructions to run the MQTT Broker without TLS |
